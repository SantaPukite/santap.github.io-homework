            <h2>Who is Bumblebee?</h2>
            <p>She was rescued from the streets of Daugavpils. 
                Found in the trash scared and malnourished surviving the drive to Riga soon found a new place to call home.</p>
            <p>Her parents saw her on the rescue page and immediately fell in love. 
                After messaging the rescue organisation and getting confirmed for adoption they were astonished.</p>
            <p>It was a semi-cold autumn day and COVID regulations were at their highest for example there even was a curfew at 8 PM. 
                Despite all obstacles, 
                Bumblebee and her new parents met. She was scared and a little sick but her parents knew she was the one.</p>
            <p>They were told that she was quiet, calm, shy, and a little scaredy pants, 
                which meant they needed to provide the right atmosphere at home and give her time. 
                But at the right place and with the right people around her, 
                she bloomed and an hour after getting settled in her new home she started zooming.</p>
            <p>And she has never stopped zooming since - living up to her name.</p>
